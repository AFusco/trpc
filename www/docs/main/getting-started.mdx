"Getting started" means different things to different people. The goal of this page is to guide you to the right resources based on your goals.

## The bare minimum to be productive in a tRPC codebase.

- Read the [concepts](./concepts.mdx) page
- Backend concepts you might want to read about in more detail sooner or later are [routers](../server/routers.md), [procedures](../server/procedures.md), [context](../server/context.md), and [middleware](../server/middlewares.md).
- If you are in a React codebase, read about [useQuery](../reactjs/useQuery.md), [useMutation](../reactjs/useMutation.md) and [useContext](../reactjs/useContext.mdx).

## Creating a new project

Since tRPC can live inside of many different frameworks, you will first need to decide what you want to use.

Some resources:

1. you need to choose what you will use for the app

- BE: adapters [adapters](../server/adapters-intro.md)
- FE:
  - RQ [rq integration](../reactjs/introduction.mdx)
  - NextJS http://localhost:3000/docs/nextjs/introduction
  - [third-party adapters](../community/awesome-trpc.mdx#frontend-frameworks)

Then you need to make another decision: do you want to use a template to scaffold your application, or start from scratch?

### Using a template

If you start from a template, your initial experience will be similar to jumping into an existing codebase, except that the scaffolded project will be much smaller than most existing codebases.

### Starting from scratch

- how to get started with a new project
  - you can use a template => like jumping into an existing codebase
  - from scratch
    - same as above but you also need to do setup
    - considerations about which adapters to use
    - read the general stuff plus the setup for chosen adapters
    - even if you build your own, the templates might be helpful as a reference

## Adding tRPC to an existing project

Adding tRPC to an existing project is not significantly different from starting a new project, so the same resources apply. The main challenge is that an existing project will contain more stuff than a new project, so it can feel difficult to know where the touching points are. Here are some tips:

- You don't need to port all of your existing backend logic to tRPC. A common migration strategy is to initally only use tRPC for new endpoints, and then gradually migrate existing endpoints to tRPC.
- If you are in a codebase that already uses Tanstack Query, make sure you don't end up with two `QueryClientProvider` components. This can happen especially in Next.js, where the `withTRPC` function already includes a QueryClientProvider of its own. If you are using `withTRPC` in your app, you should remove the `QueryClientProvider` from your `_app.tsx` file.
