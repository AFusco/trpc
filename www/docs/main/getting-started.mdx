- different sections for different goals
- how to jump into a tRPC codebase
  - queries, mutations, context, maybe middleware
  - frontend usage - query/mutate, or
- how to get started with a new project
  - you can use a template => like jumping into an existing codebase
  - from scratch
    - same as above but you also need to do setup
    - considerations about which adapters to use
    - read the general stuff plus the setup for chosen adapters
- how to get started with an existing project
  - same as "from scratch" above (know concepts + your adapters)
  - some other ideas
    - you don't need every endpoint to be tRPC
