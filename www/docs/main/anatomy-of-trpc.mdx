import { ArticleCard } from '../../src/components/ArticleCard';

todo;

also maybe theres a better name for section?

- Anatomy of a "Procedure"
- "How tRPC really works" video, but as an article
- signpost to "main" docs as much as possible
  - adapter
    - Transformers => here or in client?
  - context
  - meta
  - middleware (before or after procedure?)
  - procedure
    - query
    - mutation
    - subscription?
    - error handling?
  - Input / Output Validation
  - client
    - links
    - transformers (here or in adapter?)
    - a word about type magic
    - query / mutation
    - mention RQ hooks
- did i forget anything?
